OOPS Pillars:
      There are 4 pillars of OOPS
       1 inheritance
       2 abstraction
       3 encapsulation
       4 polymorphism

inheritance:
       Property transmission(Parent To Child) we use extends keyword
       super keyword is used to fiffrentiate between child and parent class
       
Types of inheritence:
    Single inheritence
    Multi inheritence
    multilevel inheritence
    hybrid inheritence(combination of multilevel adn herachical inheritence)
    herachical inheritance       

abstraction:
     data hiding/data limitations(by using access modifier (private,protected,public))


encapsulation:
    A data which can convert in a single unit. we can do a binding of data.

polymorphism:
    Poly means many morphism means functions . it contains method overloadinf and method overriding    

    method overloading(Compile time polymorphism):
         function with same name but different parameters
         example: add(int a, int b)

    method overriding:
         function with same name with same parameters     

method: 
     A function which associate with any class is called method
